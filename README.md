# M3.3.1
 Romraider defintions for Motronic 3.3.1 for E36 325i

I am primarily focussed on red label (623) software however have also added some silver label (965) maps.

Contains automatic checksum calculations when saving (need to click save twice).

If my work proves helpful to you, donations are appreciated. I will contribute a percentage of any donations to the ms4x dev team as without them, the ecu definitions would not be at the maturity that they currently are.
